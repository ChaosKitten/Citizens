# Citizens
Citizens is a game in which the player takes on the roles and 
responsibilities of a citizen in a town.  The town is run, managed and
inhabited by real, living, breathing human being players who control
every aspect of the town's culture, government and even the style of the
town.

## Server
The server is simply a gateway between the MySQL/XML back-end and the
clients on the network.  It's designed to be robust and scale to around
1,000 connections per instance.  The same server handles chat, 
positioning, commerce and sending map data.

## Client
The client is written using the IrrLicht graphics engine.  You will need
to install IrrLicht version 1.8 or above for the client to work.  Future
versions may bundle the IrrLicht library for simplicity's sake, on 
popular platforms.

## Chaos Kitten
Chaos Kitten Studios is the company behind Citizens, run by Chris Browne
and Miranda Schenk.
