# Citizens
Citizens is an MMO city-builder game in the same vein as games like Civilization and Age of Empires, but with more of an emphasis on expansion and economy and zero emphasis on combat.  The idea behind the game is to create a community of online players who shape the world in which they live.  Second Life is another game for comparison here, but our game has a far more restrictive toolset and a lower barrier to entry (weâ€™re also determined to discourage in-game advertisement and other nuisances that are often associated with Second Life).
